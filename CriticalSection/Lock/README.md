A reentrant lock, also known as a recursive lock, is a synchronization primitive that allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times without causing a deadlock. It is commonly used in concurrent programming to ensure that critical sections of code are executed by only one thread at a time while allowing a thread to re-enter a section of code it already owns.

Key Features of Reentrant Lock:
Reentrancy:

A thread that holds a reentrant lock can acquire it again without being blocked. This is useful when a thread enters a synchronized block of code and then calls a method that also tries to acquire the same lock.
Lock Count:

Each time a thread acquires the lock, an internal counter is incremented. When the thread releases the lock, the counter is decremented. The lock is only fully released when the counter reaches zero.
Fairness:

Some implementations of reentrant locks offer fairness policies. A fair lock grants access to the longest-waiting thread. This prevents thread starvation.
Condition Variables:

Reentrant locks often provide condition variables for finer-grained control over thread communication and synchronization.
Comparison with Other Locks:
Reentrant Lock vs. Non-reentrant Lock:

In a non-reentrant lock, if a thread that holds the lock tries to acquire it again, it will cause a deadlock because the lock does not recognize that the current thread already owns it.
Reentrant Lock vs. Synchronized Block (in Java):

The synchronized keyword in Java also provides reentrant locking. However, ReentrantLock offers additional features like timed lock waits, interruptible lock waits, and multiple condition variables.
Example in Java:
Here is an example using Java's ReentrantLock:

java
Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ReentrantLockExample {
private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void outer() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("In outer");
            inner(); // Calling inner method
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void inner() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("In inner");
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantLockExample example = new ReentrantLockExample();
        example.outer();
    }
}
In this example, the outer method acquires the lock and then calls the inner method, which tries to acquire the same lock again. With a reentrant lock, this is allowed and the program runs without deadlocking.

Advantages of Reentrant Lock:
Prevents deadlock in recursive or re-entrant method calls.
Provides more flexibility with features like tryLock, lockInterruptibly, and multiple condition variables.
Disadvantages of Reentrant Lock:
Increased complexity compared to simpler locking mechanisms like synchronized blocks.
Slightly more overhead due to additional features and flexibility.
When to Use:
Reentrant locks are useful when you need more control over locking behavior and thread synchronization than what is provided by basic locking mechanisms. They are particularly useful in complex applications where methods might call each other and need to acquire the same lock multiple times.
